This study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in their respective sections.  You can see the JavaScript working in the DevTools console.  
This guide will be used to refer back to during the upcoming coding bootcamp and will be expanded upon as I learn more concepts.
In the DevTools you will find a tool to suggest what to study first.
